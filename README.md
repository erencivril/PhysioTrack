PhysioTrack aims to develop a system that improves communication between physiotherapists and
patients, enhancing the overall physiotherapy experience. In today's healthcare setting, effective
communication and continuous monitoring are crucial for patient outcomes. The proposed system
provides a platform where patients share progress, symptoms, and treatment details, while
physiotherapists input their observations, aiming to optimize the physiotherapy process. (SE 321 Project).
